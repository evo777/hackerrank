#Task

Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

 - Inherits from Book
 - Has a parameterized constructor taking these 3 parameters:
   1. string title
   2. string author
   3. int price
 - Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these 3 lines:
1. `Title:`, a space, and then the current instance's title.
2. `Author:`, a space, and then the current instance's author.
3. `Price:`, a space, and then the current instance's price.
